## 🤖 AI Agent Development

This project was built using **Goose AI agents** for the "No Keyboards Allowed" hackathon, demonstrating the power of AI-assisted development:

### 🦆 Goose Agent Workflows Used:

- **🎵 Audio Engineering**: AI agents helped design and implement the complex Tone.js audio synthesis system
- **🎤 Voice Recognition**: Agents developed the sophisticated speech-to-command mapping system
- **🕺 Computer Vision**: AI assisted in implementing pose detection and gesture recognition
- **🎨 Visual Effects**: Agents created the dynamic visualizer and reactive animations
- **🔧 State Management**: AI helped architect the event-driven state management system
- **🎪 UI/UX Design**: Agents designed the immersive club-themed interface
- **🧪 Testing & Debugging**: AI agents helped identify and fix complex audio timing issues

### 🚀 Development Philosophy

Following the "No Keyboards Allowed" theme, this entire application was conceptualized, designed, and built using AI agents as the primary development tool. The human developer acted as a conductor, directing AI agents to implement complex features while maintaining creative control over the overall vision.
